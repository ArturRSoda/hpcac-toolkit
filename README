# Developer Notes

To develop HPC@Cloud you need the [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
You won't be able to compile the application if the sqlite file is not set up with the required tables. 
Use sqlx-cli to run the migrations first, following these instructions:

1. Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools.install
2. Create the `.env` file, copying the contents from `.example.env`. Update the variables as needed
3. Source the .env file with `source .env`
4. Install sqlx-cli with `cargo install sqlx-cli`
5. Create an empty db.sqlite file: `touch db.sqlite`
6. Run the database migrations with `sqlx migrate run --database-url $DATABASE_URL`
7. To reset the database and re-apply all migrations, run `sqlx database reset`

After the steps above are done, you can test the commands with cargo `cargo run -- <command> <arguments>`.
Run this the following to get help with the available commands:

cargo run -- help

The first thing you'll want to do is probably to set up provider credentials with the provider-config command.
Currently two providers are supported: Vultr and AWS.
To fetch your credentials, follow each documentation:

Creating AWS access keys: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/create.keypair.html
Creating a Vultr API key: https://docs.vultr.com/platform/other/api/regenerate-user-api-key
